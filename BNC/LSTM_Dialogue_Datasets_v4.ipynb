It was not as intelligent as i thought it would be, but I suppose that is a good thing. One of the things that I noticed from playing with the bot was that everything is pretty predictable. In fact, it feels less like it is responding to you and more like it has memories what to day based on an input string from the user. I think the first thing we can do to improve the model is to add some randomness to the model, so asking \"hello\" wont keep generating the same output. To improve this one a bit more we can change some of the variable like the learning rate and the depth. Eventually, to improve the overall feeling of the chat bot we can implement an entirely new model. Try to give a more meaningful number to words rather than what index they first appear in (ask professor if he thinks this would even matter, or would this just be a change of domain)."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"x5beFcW_vLHj","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1615277585630,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":11323658,"user":{"displayName":"Eric Huang","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-P2Cf_79gpe8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANo/bMeljTmWfyg/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"07926901398238831941"}}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
