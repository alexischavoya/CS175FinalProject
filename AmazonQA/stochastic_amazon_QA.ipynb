Usually, this is all that will be used by a decoder to produce output but this can result in a loss of information, expecially when the input sentences are very long. To counter this, the decoder also uses its current hidden state as a way of determining what it should be \"paying attention\" to. These are refered to as attention weights and are multiplied by the outputs from the encoder (the output that is apperantly recorded somewhere, this is where they are used) from the current time step to rescale the values, making less important parts of the encoder output smaller and more important parts of the encoder output larger. This can be further improved by using all of the encoder outputs instead of just the one of the current time step to have a more comprehensive set of attention weights. This is the method implemented below, followed by the implementation of the decoder using this attention method."

The first trick is refered to as \"teacher forcing\" which just overrides the prediction of the decoder and uses the actual target value instead, this happens with some small probability p. Doing it too much will make the decoder unable to make predictions on its own and not having this feature will make it so that convergence is just slower. The second trick they do is gradient clipping, meaning that at areas in the feature space where there is a steep gradient and therefore a chance to improve the model very fast, the magnitude of the gradient is limited some value. This is to not drastically overshoot local minima on \"cliffs\". The training function is implemented below. This trains only one iteration."

So, more like a sample with a given distrubution that just uniformly at random.

I found that a k value of 2 worked best for uniform random word choice model but this might be different for for the random sample choice model. "
