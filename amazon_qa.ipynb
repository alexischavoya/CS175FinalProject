The **decoder** takes the context vector provided by the decoder along with an input word to guess the next word in a sequence.

    "Some discussion on the Decoder. The decoder uses the context vector that is produced by the encoder. Usually, this is all that will be used by a decoder to produce output but this can result in a loss of information, expecially when the input sentences are very long. To counter this, the decoder also uses its current hidden state as a way of determining what it should be \"paying attention\" to. These are refered to as attention weights and are multiplied by the outputs from the encoder (the output that is apperantly recorded somewhere, this is where they are used) from the current time step to rescale the values, making less important parts of the encoder output smaller and more important parts of the encoder output larger. This can be further improved by using all of the encoder outputs instead of just the one of the current time step to have a more comprehensive set of attention weights. This is the method implemented below, followed by the implementation of the decoder using this attention method."

The first trick is refered to as \"teacher forcing\" which just overrides the prediction of the decoder and uses the actual target value instead, this happens with some small probability p. Doing it too much will make the decoder unable to make predictions on its own and not having this feature will make it so that convergence is just slower. The second trick they do is gradient clipping, meaning that at areas in the feature space where there is a steep gradient and therefore a chance to improve the model very fast, the magnitude of the gradient is limited some value. This is to not drastically overshoot local minima on \"cliffs\". The training function is implemented below. This trains only one iteration."

    "I like this model a whole lot more than the previous version, since it feels a lot more like a person speaking. I think there is more we can do to explore this stochastic model instead of the greedy model, for example, instead of randomly choosing the next word based off of the top k choices, only randomly choose the first word based of the top k choices then let the bot make up a new sentence based on that random first word. The reason this might be a better idea is because when the bot has a k value too large (even 5 is too large) it sort of rambles and makes weird sentences. I found that a k value of 2 worked best. "
