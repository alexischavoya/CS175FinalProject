The **decoder** takes the context vector provided by the decoder along with an input word to guess the next word in a sequence.

Usually, this is all that will be used by a decoder to produce output but this can result in a loss of information, expecially when the input sentences are very long. To counter this, the decoder also uses its current hidden state as a way of determining what it should be \"paying attention\" to. These are refered to as attention weights and are multiplied by the outputs from the encoder (the output that is apperantly recorded somewhere, this is where they are used) from the current time step to rescale the values, making less important parts of the encoder output smaller and more important parts of the encoder output larger. This can be further improved by using all of the encoder outputs instead of just the one of the current time step to have a more comprehensive set of attention weights. This is the method implemented below, followed by the implementation of the decoder using this attention method."
