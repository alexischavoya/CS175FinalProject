The **decoder** takes the context vector provided by the decoder along with an input word to guess the next word in a sequence.

Usually, this is all that will be used by a decoder to produce output but this can result in a loss of information, expecially when the input sentences are very long. To counter this, the decoder also uses its current hidden state as a way of determining what it should be \"paying attention\" to. These are refered to as attention weights and are multiplied by the outputs from the encoder (the output that is apperantly recorded somewhere, this is where they are used) from the current time step to rescale the values, making less important parts of the encoder output smaller and more important parts of the encoder output larger. This can be further improved by using all of the encoder outputs instead of just the one of the current time step to have a more comprehensive set of attention weights. This is the method implemented below, followed by the implementation of the decoder using this attention method."

    "Overall, the model is OK. It was not as intelligent as i thought it would be, but I suppose that is a good thing. One of the things that I noticed from playing with the bot was that everything is pretty predictable. In fact, it feels less like it is responding to you and more like it has memories what to day based on an input string from the user. I think the first thing we can do to improve the model is to add some randomness to the model, so asking \"hello\" wont keep generating the same output. To improve this one a bit more we can change some of the variable like the learning rate and the depth. Eventually, to improve the overall feeling of the chat bot we can implement an entirely new model. Try to give a more meaningful number to words rather than what index they first appear in (ask professor if he thinks this would even matter, or would this just be a change of domain)."
